The code that was generated by umple had a lot more complexity than my code. The reason for this is because
it accounted for the fact that there could be multiple orders for on account. The code also created a
constructor for each of the classes which I had mistakenly left out of mine. It also made the constructors
so that when a customer is created there is also enough info for the other classes The plugin could be useful
because if you create a structure for the program you are going to write it can automatically crteate a
basic outline of the program that you are planning to write. It could also be useful as a way to check if
you created you classes correctly and to catch anything that you may have missed when you created them.
